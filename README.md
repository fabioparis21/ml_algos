Collection of examples of usage of the most common machine learning algorithms.

The purpose of this repository is to archive examples of code that I'm writing to learn and practice machine learning.

This repo also includes a visualization algorithm (viz.py) that is used to show the decision boundaries of the support vector machine algorithm.
